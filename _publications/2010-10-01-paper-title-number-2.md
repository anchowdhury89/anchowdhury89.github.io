We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and exponentially improves the dependence on precision over known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain.  Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the dependence on precision and a gap parameter over an analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations.
