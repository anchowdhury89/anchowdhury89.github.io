I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/people/profile/a2chnara/) in the Institute for Quantum Computing and the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/) at the University of Waterloo. I am broadly interested in quantum algorithms, quantum simulation, Hamiltonian complexity and classical simulation of quantum many-body systems. My postdoc supervisor is [David Gosset](http://www.davidgosset.com/). 
I have a PhD in physics from the [University of New Mexico](www.unm.edu) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Rolando Somma](https://sites.google.com/site/rolandodsom/).

Updates
======
### Mar 17, 2021: _New paper!_ [Computing partition functions in the one-clean-qubit model](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.032422) with Rolando Somma and Yigit Subasi.

The one-clean-qubit model dates back to the early days of quantum computing. It was used to show that the an NMR quantum information processor can give computational advantage over classical computers, despite having very little to no entanglement. We give an algorithm to compute partition functions of quantum Hamiltonians in this model, and argue that it can lead to polynomial speed-ups in certain cases.
One of our main technical contributions here is a general-purpose classical algorithm to estimate a quantity within multiplicative error. Given a procedure to estimate a quantity within adjustable additive error, our algorithm can simply iterate this multiple times and get a multiplicative estimate.

I gave a talk about this paper at TQC 2020, linked below.

Academic history
======
Before joining IQC, I did a postdoc at the Universit&#x00E9; de Sherbrooke in the group of David Poulin.

I got my PhD in 2019 from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, under the guidance of [Rolando Somma](https://sites.google.com/site/rolandodsom/). I was a member of the [Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC)](https://cquic.unm.edu/) and also spent a year working at the [Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/index.php) as a Graduate Research Assistant.

My PhD research contributed to some of the early work in using series approximations, quantum amplitude amplification, and block-encoding techniques to implement matrix functions on quantum computers. 
This led to new and improved quantum algorithms for, e.g., [preparing thermal states on quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02940). We showed similar improvements in the number of gates and qubits needed to implement other algorithms for quantum state-preparation and speeding up Markov chains. We also came up with a quantum algorithm to estimate the hitting-time of a Markov chain.  
All of this can be found in my dissertation - ["Quantum Algorithms with Applications to Simulating Physical Systems"](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/phyc_etds/229/).

During my PhD, I interned at Microsoft Quantum in Redmond, where I worked with [Nathan Wiebe](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/people/nathan-wiebe/) on variational quantum algorithms.


Further back
======
I graduated in 2013 from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) with a Bachelors and Masters degree.

I took an interest in relativity and high-energy physics back then. My first paper was in theoretical astrophysics - a result of two great months spent at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in the group of [Pankaj Joshi](https://web.tifr.res.in/~psj/).

I had my first brush with quantum information and computation at IISER, thanks to a course taught by [T. S. Mahesh](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~mahesh.ts/homepage.htm). I ended up writing a Masters thesis on ["Quantum measurements with post-selection"](http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/255).
