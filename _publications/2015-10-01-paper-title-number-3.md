excerpt: 'We give algorithms for computing the quantum partition function in a model of computation that uses only one clean qubit. The algorithms are based on decomposing the exponential operator into a linear combination of real time-evolutions or operators related to block-encodings. A consequence of our work is that the complexity of approximating the normalized partition function within additive error turns out to be complete for the complexity class DQC1. We also develop a classical algorithm to obtain a multiplicative estimate based on a sequence of approximations within predetermined additive error.'

We give algorithms for computing the quantum partition function in a model of computation that uses only one clean qubit. The algorithms are based on decomposing the exponential operator into a linear combination of real time-evolutions or operators related to block-encodings. A consequence of our work is that the complexity of approximating the normalized partition function within additive error turns out to be complete for the complexity class DQC1. We also develop a classical algorithm to obtain a multiplicative estimate based on a sequence of approximations within predetermined additive error.
