I am a [Postdoctoral Fellow](https://services.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/people/profile/a2chnara/) in the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo. My research interests are in quantum algorithms and complexity, mostly pertaining to the simulation of quantum systems. Recently, I have also been looking into classical approximation algorithms for quantum many-body systems. My postdoc supervisor is Prof. [David Gosset](http://www.davidgosset.com/). Officially, I am affiliated with the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/).

### Mar 17, 2021: _New paper!_ [Computing partition functions in the one-clean-qubit model](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.032422)
The one-clean-qubit model dates back to the early days of quantum computing. It was used to show that the an NMR quantum information processor can give computational advantage over classical computers, despite having very little to no entanglement. We give an algorithm to compute partition functions of quantum Hamiltonians in this model, and argue that it can lead to polynomial speed-ups in certain cases.
One of our main technical contributions here is a general-purpose classical algorithm to estimate a quantity within multiplicative error. Given a procedure to estimate a quantity within adjustable additive error, our algorithm can simply iterate this multiple times and get a multiplicative estimate.

I gave a talk about this work at TQC 2020 and the recording can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc_rWyCVZRY&t=17161s) (starts at 4:46:00).

Academic history
======
I got my PhD in 2019 from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, under the guidance of [Dr. Rolando Somma](https://sites.google.com/site/rolandodsom/). I was a part of the amazing [Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC)](https://cquic.unm.edu/), one of the first research centers in quantum information science anywhere. I also spent some time working in the [Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/index.php) as a Graduate Research Assistant.

During my PhD, I got to spend a wonderful three months interning at Microsoft Quantum in Redmond, where I worked with [Nathan Wiebe](https://cqiqc.physics.utoronto.ca/people/nathan-wiebe/) on variational quantum algorithms.

Before joining IQC, I was a postdoc at the Universite de Sherbrooke.


Further back
======
I graduated in 2013 from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) with a Bachelors and Masters degree.

I took an interest in relativity and high-energy physics back then. My first paper was in theoretical astrophysics - a result of two great months spent at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in the group of [Prof. Pankaj Joshi](https://web.tifr.res.in/~psj/).

I had my first brush with quantum information and computation at IISER, thanks to a course taught by [Prof. T. S. Mahesh](http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~mahesh.ts/homepage.htm). I ended up writing a Masters thesis on "Quantum measurements with post-selection".
